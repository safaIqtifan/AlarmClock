/**
 * # State Machine
 *
 * State machine (SM) processes incoming events in its [currentState]. If this state cannot handle
 * the event ([State.onEvent] returned false), event is propagated to the parent of the state.
 *
 * ## State pattern
 *
 * SM has a finite amount of states of which exactly one is the current state. SM delegates
 * processing of incoming events to this state. State can be changed by the SM itself as a reaction
 * to an external event.
 *
 * [State pattern on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_pattern)
 *
 * [State Machine on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine)
 *
 * ## Hierarchical Finite State Machine
 *
 * States are organized as a rooted forest (union of rooted trees). SM has multiple sub-hierarchies,
 * each one is a rooted tree. If a state was not able to process an event (returned *false* from
 * [State.onEvent]), the event if delivered to the parent of this state.
 *
 * **Any state can be current state, not just leaf states**
 *
 * [Tree on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(graph_theory))
 *
 * ## Event propagation
 *
 * Consider this SM, which is in the *x* state:
 * ```
 *          root       O
 *        /      \      \
 *       A        B      M
 *     /  \     /  \      \
 *   a    b   *x*    y     G
 * ```
 * If *x* is not able to handle an event, it is delivered to B, which is a parent of *x*. If B is
 * also not able to handle this event, it goes to the next parent. If no parent is available (root
 * was not able to handle), an exception is thrown. O-M-G is a separate hierarchy which is not used
 * in this case (no common parent).
 *
 * [HFSM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UML_state_machine#Hierarchically_nested_states)
 *
 * ## Transitions
 *
 * Transition is a change of the SM state due to an external event. Transitions trigger [State.exit]
 * and [State.enter] on the states which are involved in the transition. All states in the hierarchy
 * are notified, not only the leaf states.
 *
 * Consider moving from *x* to *y*:
 * ```
 *
 *          root         ->             ->         root
 *        /      \       ->             ->       /      \
 *       A        B      -> from x to y ->      A        B
 *     /  \     /  \     ->             ->    /  \     /  \
 *   a    b   *x*    y   ->             ->   a    b  x    *y*
 * ```
 * States will be notified in this order: x.exit(), y.enter(). The B state will not get any event
 * because root was not exited or entered.
 *
 * * Consider moving from *a* to *y*:
 * ```
 *          root         ->             ->         root
 *        /      \       ->             ->       /      \
 *       A        B      -> from x to b ->      A        B
 *     /  \     /  \     ->             ->    /  \      /  \
 *  *a*    b   x    y    ->             ->   a    b    x   *y*
 * ```
 * States will be notified in this order: a.exit(), A.exit(), B.enter(), y.enter(). The root state
 * will not get any event because root was not exited or entered. A and B states are parent states
 * of the leaf states and they also receive [State.enter] and [State.exit]. Both callbacks will
 * receive the **reason** - an external event which has caused the transition.
 *
 * ## Transitions between trees
 *
 * Consider moving from *a* to *M*:
 * ```
 *          root        O       ->             ->         root        O
 *        /      \       \      ->             ->       /      \       \
 *       A        B       M     -> from x to L ->      A        B      *M*
 *     /  \     /  \       \    ->             ->    /  \     /  \       \
 *  *a*    b   x    y       G   ->             ->   a    b    x   y       G
 * ```
 * States will be notified in this order: a.exit(), A.exit(), root.exit(), O.enter(), M.enter().
